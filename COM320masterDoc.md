|       |       | particularly in managing relationships with |        |
|       |       | various stakeholders. It emphasizes that PR |        |
|       |       | is not just about generating favorable      |        |
|       |       | publicity, but also about managing mutually |        |
|       |       | beneficial relationships with the public.   |        |

|       |       | The text highlights the shift in focus from |        |
|       |       | publicity to relationships in PR that       |        |
|       |       | started in the 1980s. It mentions the work  |        |
|       |       | of Professors Mary Ann Ferguson, John       |        |
|       |       | Ledingham, and Stephen Bruning who          |        |
|       |       | advocated for relationships to be at the    |        |
|       |       | core of PR scholarship.                     |        |

|       |       | The rise of social media has further        |        |
|       |       | emphasized the importance of relationship   |        |
|       |       | building in PR, as it provides a more       |        |
|       |       | direct and conversational way of            |        |
|       |       | communicating with the public.              |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | The text also discusses the strategies for  |        |
|       |       | maintaining successful relationships, based |        |
|       |       | on the work of Professors Dan Canary and    |        |
|       |       | Laura Stafford. These strategies include    |        |
|       |       | positivity, openness, assurances, social    |        |
|       |       | networking, and sharing tasks. These        |        |
|       |       | strategies were later adapted for public    |        |
|       |       | relationships by Professors Linda Hon and   |        |
|       |       | James Grunig.                               |        |

|       |       | The benefits of these relationships can     |        |
|       |       | come in many forms, such as exchange        |        |
|       |       | relationships where both parties receive    |        |
|       |       | something of value. For example, a customer |        |
|       |       | gets a product or service, and the company  |        |
|       |       | earns sales revenue.                        |        |

|       |       | The text also explores the concept of       |        |
|       |       | pitching, which is when public relations    |        |

|       |       | cover stories involving their               |        |
|       |       | organizations. It highlights the importance |        |
|       |       | of understanding newsworthiness, which is   |        |
|       |       | the criterion journalists use to determine  |        |
|       |       | what is worth covering as news. The         |        |
|       |       | elements of newsworthiness include          |        |
|       |       | timeliness, proximity, conflict and         |        |

|       |       | connect reporters with sources, a practice  |        |
|       |       | known as media catching. This practice      |        |
|       |       | reverses the traditional flow of pitching   |        |
|       |       | from sources to reporters, allowing         |        |

|       |       | public relations planning. It provides the  |        |
|       |       | context for identifying problems or         |        |
|       |       | opportunities by analyzing the current      |        |
|       |       | situation, paving the way for strategic     |        |
|       |       | planning. Techniques like SWOT analysis are |        |
|       |       | used to identify strengths, weaknesses,     |        |
|       |       | opportunities, and threats.                 |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | The chapter also differentiates between     |        |
|       |       | researching factors of internal origin      |        |
|       |       | (strengths and weaknesses) and those of     |        |
|       |       | external origin (opportunities and          |        |
|       |       | threats). Strengths are positive internal   |        |
|       |       | factors that aid in achieving               |        |
|       |       | organizational goals, while weaknesses are  |        |
|       |       | internal limitations that obstruct goal     |        |
|       |       | fulfillment. Opportunities and threats, on  |        |
|       |       | the other hand, are external factors that   |        |
|       |       | can either benefit or pose risks to the     |        |
|       |       | organization.                               |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | Researching strengths involves identifying  |        |
|       |       | and understanding the organization\'s       |        |
|       |       | positive aspects, such as                   |        |
|       |       | community-benefiting projects or faculty    |        |
|       |       | involvement in external organizations.      |        |
|       |       | Conversely, researching weaknesses requires |        |
|       |       | identifying areas of improvement within the |        |
|       |       | organization, such as communication gaps or |        |
|       |       | lack of training.                           |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | Researching opportunities entails           |        |
|       |       | identifying external circumstances that can |        |
|       |       | benefit the organization, while researching |        |
|       |       | threats involves analyzing external risks   |        |
|       |       | like competition or financial challenges.   |        |
|       |       | These factors require careful examination,  |        |
|       |       | prioritization, and understanding of their  |        |
|       |       | interrelationships.                         |        |

|       |       | In conclusion, research plays a pivotal     |        |
|       |       | role in effective public relations          |        |

|       |       | process\'s implementation phase in public   |        |
|       |       | relations. It highlights the importance of  |        |
|       |       | meaningful action, stating that effective   |        |
|       |       | public relations hinge not merely on        |        |
|       |       | communication, but also on principled       |        |
|       |       | actions. Examples from the American Red     |        |
|       |       | Cross and Ford Motor Company serve to       |        |
|       |       | underline this concept. Further emphasis is |        |
|       |       | laid on the vital role of appropriate       |        |
|       |       | communication channels in public relations. |        |
|       |       | Organizations are advised to make educated  |        |
|       |       | decisions regarding which channels to use,  |        |
|       |       | when to use them, and for what purpose,     |        |
|       |       | emphasizing the necessity of assessing the  |        |
|       |       | benefits and drawbacks of various media for |        |

|       |       | In discussing media options, the chapter    |        |
|       |       | introduces concepts like controlled,        |        |
|       |       | uncontrolled, and shared control media.     |        |
|       |       | Controlled media, such as newsletters or TV |        |
|       |       | ads, provide exact control over message,    |        |
|       |       | delivery, and audience, while uncontrolled  |        |
|       |       | media, including newspapers and blogs, do   |        |
|       |       | not offer control after the message is      |        |
|       |       | handed to a third party. A balance is found |        |
|       |       | in situations like press conferences where  |        |
|       |       | control is shared.                          |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | Further categorization of media options is  |        |
|       |       | provided as \"Owned, Paid, Shared, and      |        |
|       |       | Earned Media.\" Owned Media comprises       |        |
|       |       | channels like newsletters, websites, blogs, |        |
|       |       | where organizations control the message and |        |

|       |       | advertising, either traditional or digital, |        |
|       |       | including platforms like Google AdWords,    |        |
|       |       | banner ads, and native advertising. Shared  |        |
|       |       | Media pertains to sharing via social media, |        |
|       |       | and Earned Media involves news coverage or  |        |
|       |       | followers acquired through the              |        |
|       |       | organization\'s activities or high-quality  |        |
|       |       | content. These media categories aid in      |        |
|       |       | creating effective communication            |        |
|       |       | strategies, considering factors such as     |        |
|       |       | control level, cost, reach, and             |        |
|       |       | interactivity.                              |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | The chapter also presents case studies      |        |
|       |       | highlighting the principles discussed. One  |        |
|       |       | focuses on Chipotle Mexican Grill\'s        |        |
|       |       | response to a severe food safety crisis in  |        |
|       |       | 2016, showing how the company maintained    |        |
|       |       | relationships with its publics through      |        |
|       |       | action and communication, sticking to its   |        |
|       |       | commitment to quality ingredients and       |        |
|       |       | respectful farming practices. Another       |        |
|       |       | instance involves Lockheed Martin\'s social |        |
|       |       | media campaign backfiring due to negative   |        |
|       |       | publicity, showcasing the risks of          |        |
|       |       | open-ended social media campaigns.          |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | Moreover, the chapter illustrates how a mix |        |
|       |       | of owned, paid, shared, and earned media    |        |
|       |       | can be used effectively through the BarkBox |        |
|       |       | case study. BarkBox employed humor and      |        |
|       |       | user-generated content across social media  |        |
|       |       | platforms, sponsored events, and            |        |
|       |       | philanthropy, gradually venturing into      |        |
|       |       | traditional media and physical retail       |        |
|       |       | spaces, showing adaptability and            |        |
|       |       | responsiveness in its implementation        |        |

|       |       | Diversity, ethics, and communication are    |        |
|       |       | also highlighted as critical components in  |        |
|       |       | public relations, with a focus on Wells     |        |
|       |       | Fargo\'s \"Re-Established\" campaign led by |        |
|       |       | Rosanna M. Fiske, senior vice president of  |        |
|       |       | corporate communications. The campaign      |        |
|       |       | aimed at improving the company\'s           |        |
|       |       | reputation by concentrating on core values  |        |
|       |       | including customer centricity, ethics,      |        |
|       |       | diversity and inclusion, and leadership.    |        |
|       |       | Kimberly-Clark\'s diversity promotion       |        |
|       |       | efforts serve as a practical example of how |        |
|       |       | diversity initiatives contribute to         |        |
|       |       | business success, resulting in significant  |        |
|       |       | increases in women in leadership roles and  |        |
|       |       | internal promotions of women.               |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | Key terms in this chapter include           |        |
|       |       | advertorial, brochureware, controlled       |        |

|       | What  | Chapter 7 got me thinking about the         | This   |
|       | Makes | control, or lack thereof, we have over      | is a   |
|       | S     | social media in the world of public         | well-w |
|       | ocial | relations. It\'s easy to think that we, as  | ritten |
|       | Media | PR practitioners, have the reins, but the   | and    |
|       | Unc   | truth is once a post goes live, it\'s kind  | w      |
|       | ontro | of out of our hands.                        | ell-re |
|       | lled? |                                             | asoned |
|       |       | Social media is like a wild horse, you can  | res    |
|       |       | guide it, but you can\'t totally control    | ponse, |
|       |       | where it goes. We might create the content, | Jed.   |
|       |       | but the moment it gets posted, it\'s up for | You    |
|       |       | grabs. Users can comment, share, twist, and | are    |
|       |       | spin our messages, turning our well-planned | doing  |
|       |       | post into something we didn\'t quite        | exc    |
|       |       | anticipate.                                 | ellent |
|       |       |                                             | work   |
|       |       | Social media blurs the lines between owned, | in     |
|       |       | paid, shared, and earned media. One moment  | this   |
|       |       | it\'s an owned channel, the next it's being | c      |
|       |       | shared and talked about by influencers and  | ourse. |
|       |       | random users. Our content is out there      |        |
|       |       | living its own life, and sometimes, it\'s a |        |
|       |       | life we didn\'t exactly plan for it.        |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | Despite this wild ride, it\'s not all doom  |        |
|       |       | and gloom. We can\'t control the narrative  |        |
|       |       | entirely, but we can set a solid            |        |
|       |       | foundation. It\'s all about crafting our    |        |
|       |       | messages with care, responding to feedback, |        |
|       |       | and keeping an eye on the conversation.     |        |
|       |       | Plus, building strong relationships with    |        |
|       |       | your audience can help to strengthen your   |        |
|       |       | reputation in crisis times.                 |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | To sum up, the world of social media in     |        |
|       |       | public relations is a balancing act. While  |        |
|       |       | we can do everything in our power to create |        |
|       |       | a thoughtful message, we can\'t control     |        |
|       |       | everything that comes after. But knowing    |        |
|       |       | this and navigating the unpredictability is |        |
|       |       | what makes PR so engaging.                  |        |
+-------+-------+---------------------------------------------+--------+
|       | The   | So, I took on the task of scrutinizing my   | Good,  |
|       | Value | own social media accounts. Funny enough, I  | Jed.   |
|       | of    | found a big fat zero in the shared content  | It\'s  |
|       | Sh    | column for the past week. I\'m more of an   | inter  |
|       | aring | observer on social media platforms rather   | esting |
|       |       | than an active participant. I scroll, I     | but I  |
|       |       | read, I watch, but I don\'t necessarily     | am     |
|       |       | engage by sharing or posting much.          | f      |
|       |       |                                             | inding |
|       |       | The reasons are twofold. First, I tend to   | that   |
|       |       | consume content more passively, using these | as we  |
|       |       | platforms to stay informed about what\'s    | move   |
|       |       | happening in the world, with friends, and   | deeper |
|       |       | in areas of interest to me. So, I\'m more   | into   |
|       |       | likely to be found browsing my feeds and    | the    |
|       |       | stories rather than resharing them.         | social |
|       |       |                                             | media  |
|       |       | Secondly, I have an innate tendency to keep | era,   |
|       |       | my online presence on the down-low. For me, | th     |
|       |       | social media is where I like to relax, I    | ere\'s |
|       |       | find the task of posting things and trying  | a      |
|       |       | to keep up with them, and then starting it  | g      |
|       |       | over every day or week or whenever, very    | rowing |
|       |       | tiring. I like to keep my off time as       | number |
|       |       | stress-free as possible, and I plan to keep | of     |
|       |       | it that way.                                | users  |
|       |       |                                             | like   |
|       |       | However, this exercise was eye-opening in   | you    |
|       |       | terms of understanding my own digital       | who    |
|       |       | footprint, or lack thereof. It was also     | views  |
|       |       | interesting to reflect on Chapter 7\'s      | social |
|       |       | content and its relevance to my own social  | media  |
|       |       | media behavior. While I don\'t contribute   | w      |
|       |       | much to the realm of shared media, I        | ithout |
|       |       | realize how vital it is in the digital      | re     |
|       |       | communication landscape.                    | acting |
|       |       |                                             | to it  |
|       |       | In the end, it\'s clear that the concept of | or     |
|       |       | sharing on social media isn\'t              | s      |
|       |       | one-size-fits-all. We all interact with     | haring |
|       |       | these platforms in our unique ways, and     | it.    |
|       |       | that\'s what makes the social media world   | When   |
|       |       | so diverse and vibrant. It\'s a melting pot | social |
|       |       | of personalities, behaviors, and content,   | media  |
|       |       | and I\'m happy to be a part of it, even if  | a      |

|       | Adv   | instead of just trying to sell their        | very   |

|       | A     | Gillette\'s "We Believe: The Best Men Can   | res    |

|       |       | while others like when companies stand up   | polit  |

|       |       | reliability and validity are key concepts.  |        |
|       |       | Reliability refers to the consistency of    |        |
|       |       | the measurement, such as using the same     |        |
|       |       | coding system to measure the quality of     |        |
|       |       | news coverage. Validity, on the other hand, |        |

|       |       | Focus Groups: Focus groups are more         |        |
|       |       | effective when led by a trained moderator.  |        |
|       |       | This is because a trained moderator has the |        |
|       |       | skills to facilitate discussion and ensure  |        |
|       |       | that all participants\' views are heard.    |        |

|       |       | Types of Research: Quantitative research    |        |
|       |       | involves numerical data, such as            |        |
|       |       | demographic statistics, the number of email |        |
|       |       | accounts that have received an invitation,  |        |
|       |       | or the number of people who respond to a    |        |
|       |       | Facebook invitation. Qualitative research,  |        |
|       |       | on the other hand, involves non-numerical   |        |
|       |       | data and focuses on understanding the       |        |
|       |       | meaning and experiences of individuals.     |        |

|       |       | various terms used in public relations that |        |
|       |       | you should be familiar with. For instance,  |        |

|       |       | end of a campaign to determine its          |        |

|       |       | formal explanation of an organization's     |        |
|       |       | steady, enduring purpose. A \"latent        |        |

|       |       | Media and Communication: In a focus group,  |        |
|       |       | a trained moderator is essential to         |        |

|       |       | Chapter 11 explores the crucial role of     |        |
|       |       | public relations (PR) professionals in      |        |
|       |       | navigating the intricate landscape of       |        |
|       |       | ethics, intellectual property rights,       |        |
|       |       | privacy, and legal considerations. It       |        |
|       |       | emphasizes the significance of              |        |
|       |       | understanding national laws within global   |        |
|       |       | contexts, given the rise of international   |        |
|       |       | exchanges and globalization.                |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | The chapter opens by emphasizing the        |        |
|       |       | importance of understanding the legal       |        |
|       |       | landscape, not only domestically but also   |        |
|       |       | internationally. It uses the case of Supap  |        |
|       |       | Kirtsaeng and the \"first sale\" doctrine   |        |
|       |       | to demonstrate how national laws are        |        |
|       |       | interpreted in international contexts and   |        |
|       |       | how globalization is influencing the legal  |        |
|       |       | framework.                                  |        |

|       |       | the United States and the role of PR        |        |
|       |       | professionals in the marketplace of ideas   |        |
|       |       | are highlighted. The chapter stresses the   |        |
|       |       | need to balance free speech with            |        |
|       |       | responsibilities, understanding that while  |        |
|       |       | free speech is a right, it is not unlimited |        |
|       |       | and should not infringe on others\' rights  |        |
|       |       | or reputations.                             |        |

|       |       | The chapter then dives into the             |        |
|       |       | complexities of intellectual property       |        |
|       |       | protection, focusing on copyright,          |        |
|       |       | trademarks, patents, and the role of        |        |
|       |       | Creative Commons licenses. It highlights    |        |
|       |       | the international distribution of digital   |        |
|       |       | content and the challenges it presents for  |        |
|       |       | intellectual property across borders.       |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | Privacy, particularly within an             |        |
|       |       | international context, is a key area of     |        |
|       |       | exploration. The chapter discusses the      |        |
|       |       | legal rights and responsibilities related   |        |
|       |       | to privacy, the EU\'s General Data          |        |
|       |       | Protection Regulation, and how              |        |
|       |       | international companies have had to adapt   |        |
|       |       | to these new regulations.                   |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | Defamation, including libel and slander, is |        |
|       |       | examined in-depth. The modern ramifications |        |

|       |       | explored with the introduction of the term  |        |
|       |       | \"twibel,\" signifying libel on Twitter.    |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | The roles and responsibilities of various   |        |
|       |       | U.S. federal agencies like the Federal      |        |
|       |       | Trade Commission (FTC), Food and Drug       |        |
|       |       | Administration (FDA), and Securities and    |        |
|       |       | Exchange Commission (SEC) are identified.   |        |
|       |       | These agencies regulate communication to    |        |
|       |       | protect the public, highlighting the need   |        |
|       |       | for PR professionals to be familiar with    |        |
|       |       | these agencies.                             |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | Next, the chapter distinguishes between     |        |
|       |       | intellectual property and public domain     |        |
|       |       | information, highlighting laws like the     |        |
|       |       | Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in the    |        |
|       |       | United States that ensure government        |        |
|       |       | information is accessible to citizens. It   |        |
|       |       | points out that more than 100 U.S. agencies |        |
|       |       | are subject to FOIA and underscores their   |        |
|       |       | obligation to respond to information        |        |
|       |       | requests and proactively provide useful     |        |
|       |       | information.                                |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | The chapter further underscores the ethical |        |
|       |       | balance between protecting organizational   |        |
|       |       | confidences and respecting the privacy of   |        |
|       |       | individual social media accounts. It raises |        |
|       |       | questions around whether social networks    |        |
|       |       | can be considered trade secrets and         |        |
|       |       | discusses the ethical implications of       |        |
|       |       | organizations claiming ownership over       |        |
|       |       | employees\' social media accounts.          |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | Lastly, the chapter advises caution with    |        |
|       |       | sharing content on social media, the use of |        |
|       |       | customer relationship management (CRM)      |        |
|       |       | systems, and the handling of large amounts  |        |
|       |       | of data. PR professionals are urged to      |        |
|       |       | respect customer trust, avoid common legal  |        |
|       |       | mistakes such as oversharing on social      |        |
|       |       | media, and understand the legal contexts    |        |
|       |       | both nationally and internationally.        |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | In conclusion, Chapter 11 provides a        |        |
|       |       | comprehensive guide for PR professionals,   |        |
|       |       | equipping them with the knowledge and tools |        |
|       |       | necessary to navigate the legal and ethical |        |
|       |       | landscape of their field. The chapter       |        |
|       |       | reinforces the importance of adherence to   |        |
|       |       | legal norms, respecting intellectual        |        |
|       |       | property, ensuring transparency, protecting |        |
|       |       | privacy, safeguarding confidential          |        |
|       |       | information, and ultimately, building trust |        |
|       |       | and maintaining credibility in public       |        |
|       |       | relations.                                  |        |

|       |       |                                             |        |

|       |       | If Best Burger is considered a public       |        |
|       |       | figure or entity, the legal threshold for   |        |
|       |       | defamation may be higher, requiring the     |        |
|       |       | demonstration of actual malice, where the   |        |
|       |       | defendant knowingly made a false statement  |        |
|       |       | or acted with reckless disregard for the    |        |

|       |       | This tweet appears to be someone expressing |        |
|       |       | their strong negative opinion about Best    |        |
|       |       | Burger. It uses hyperbole and subjective    |        |
|       |       | language to convey their dissatisfaction.   |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | This statement is someone's subjective      |        |
|       |       | experience, akin to a review of the         |        |
|       |       | restaurant.                                 |        |

|       |       | \"Best Burger's food tastes like cardboard. |        |
|       |       | It isn't even real food.\"                  |        |

|       |       | This tweet also expresses a personal        |        |
|       |       | opinion about the taste of Best Burger\'s   |        |
|       |       | food. It uses subjective language to convey |        |
|       |       | the individual\'s dissatisfaction.          |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | Like the previous tweet, it is difficult to |        |
|       |       | prove this statement as false, as taste     |        |
|       |       | preferences vary among individuals.         |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | \"Best Burger is not worth the price. They  |        |
|       |       | use dog food to make their hamburgers.\"    |        |

|       |       | In this tweet, the person is making a claim |        |
|       |       | that Best Burger uses dog food in their     |        |
|       |       | hamburgers.                                 |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | If this statement is false, it could        |        |
|       |       | potentially be considered defamatory        |        |
|       |       | because it implies a harmful fact about     |        |
|       |       | Best Burger\'s business practices.          |        |
|       |       |                                             |        |
|       |       | The issue in the third tweet would be       |        |
|       |       | proving actual harm to the company directly |        |
|       |       | because of the tweet. Perhaps, if it went   |        |
|       |       | viral worldwide and seriously impacted      |        |
|       |       | their stock values, then I could definitely |        |
|       |       | see it being legally defamatory.            |        |

|       |       | The media played a significant role in      |        |

|       |       | Bud Light faced ethical conflicts as it     |        |
|       |       | navigated the crisis, with concerns raised  |        |
|       |       | about their commitment to the LGBTQ+        |        |
|       |       | community and criticism for their perceived |        |

|       |       | Bud Light did not employ the \"stealing     |        |
|       |       | thunder\" strategy, as they were reactive   |        |
|       |       | rather than proactive in disclosing         |        |
|       |       | negative information about the controversy. |        |

|       |       | In conclusion, Bud Light\'s response to the |        |
|       |       | crisis demonstrated a combination of        |        |
|       |       | strategies aligned with the concepts        |        |
|       |       | discussed in Chapter 12. However, the       |        |
|       |       | company\'s approach was largely reactive,   |        |
|       |       | and it faced criticism for its handling of  |        |
|       |       | the situation, highlighting the importance  |        |
