	Chapter 1 Detailed Summary
	Engagement, conversation, influence, transparency, and trust are key elements in public relations. Managing communication between organizations and their publics, while maintaining mutually beneficial relationships, is crucial. Social media and digital communication technologies play an important role in modern public relations. Good public relations focuses on an organization's actions rather than just its image. Arthur Page's seven principles for successful PR management are still relevant in the digital age, emphasizing transparency, action, and proactive planning.
Crock-Pot's PR crisis in 2018 demonstrated the importance of conversational voice and humor in maintaining good relationships with the public online. Ethics also play a critical role in public relations. Fitzpatrick's six-step guide for ethical decision-making helps practitioners handle ethical dilemmas, and social media can both facilitate and challenge ethical communication.
Professional associations like PRSA and IPRA establish codes of ethics to guide their members worldwide, sharing common moral principles across cultures. The IPRA Code of Conduct focuses on human rights, dignity, and issues specific to online media, such as trust, credibility, and privacy. These organizations promote ethical and effective practices to improve public relations for the benefit of students, practitioners, and society.
Understanding public relations involves considering the relationships between organizations and their publics. Effective listening includes participation in online communities and traditional research. Responding constructively and politely to online critics is essential, and reviewing organizations' codes of ethics helps to understand the values members embrace

In Chapter 1, “Principled Public Relations,” the PRSA defines public relations as “a
process of communicating between organizations and their public to achieve mutually beneficial
outcomes.” Olivia Pope, a fictional character from the television show “Scandal,” is one public
relations professional that comes to mind.
Olivia Pope, played by Kerry Washington, is the CEO of Pope & Associates, a public
relations firm that handles crises. As a public image and reputation manager, she protects the
public image and reputation of celebrities, politicians, and corporations. A few of Olivia Pope's
responsibilities include managing scandals, crafting strategic messaging, liaising with the media,
and handling crisis situations. She also uses research to predict the public’s opinion and
counsels her clients on how to hand their public relations.
Olivia Pope’s job ticks a lot of the boxes for the textbook’s definition of PR. She works to
build mutually beneficial relationships, handles crisis communications, and manages media
relations for her various high-profile clients.
As a sidenote, Olivia Pope involves herself in ethically uncertain tasks; for the sake of
television dramatics. This behavior, however, falls outside the textbook definition of a good PR
professional.

	Thanks, Jed. I've not watched that show so I am not familiar with Olivia Pope, but it's not unusual for public relations practitioners to be depicted as somewhat unethical within the popular media. Just as within any profession, public relations does have its share of unethical characters but my experience has been that the vast majority of professionals really strive to serve their clients and the public good with integrity.


	

	Analyze the Ethical Issues in a Current PR Crisis


	Ethical Considerations of Recent Bud Light Crisis
Defining The Crisis:
The central ethical conflict in this case involves balancing Anheuser-Busch's
business interests, such as expanding its customer base and maintaining its market
position, with the potential social repercussions of its sponsorship decisions and
prior support of anti-LGBTQ politicians.
Identifying Factors:
Internal factors affecting the decision-making process include the company's
sponsorship policies and values, as well as the organizational culture and ethical
stance of the company's leadership. External factors encompass public opinion, the
influence of shareholders, potential financial losses resulting from boycotts, and
the need for collaboration with law enforcement due to bomb threats.
Identifying key values:
The key values at play in this situation are inclusivity, diversity, social
responsibility, and transparency. Anheuser-Busch must navigate these values to
maintain its credibility and address the concerns of various stakeholders.
Identifying Affected Parties:
The affected parties include conservative groups calling for a boycott, the
LGBTQ+ community, Bud Light's customers, the company's shareholders, and its
employees. The public relations professional must consider each of these parties'
interests while upholding ethical principles.
Ethical Principles At Play:
To address this crisis ethically, the public relations professional should follow
the principles of honesty, fairness, and respect for diverse perspectives. By being
transparent about the company's sponsorship decisions and prior political
donations, Anheuser-Busch can demonstrate accountability and a commitment to
addressing the concerns of various stakeholders.
	Excellent analysis, Jed. You seem to have a good handle on Fitzpatrick's guidelines. This is a particularly thorny situation for the company. Your recommendations are solid.

	Chapter 2
	Grunig and Hunt identify four PR models: press agentry/publicity, public information, two-way asymmetrical, and two-way symmetrical.
Ivy Lee is associated with the public information model, emphasizing transparency and truthfulness.
Edward Bernays used research and persuasive tactics to increase female smoking and bacon consumption.
Bernays and Fleischman's partnership may have influenced a balanced, two-way symmetrical communication model.
Two-way symmetrical model can increase PR's contribution to organizational effectiveness.
PR history teaches the importance of being ethical, as the truth always comes out.
Transparency, objectivity, and advocacy are cornerstones of PR ethics.
American PR history has shaped differences in PR practices between countries, with significant cross-pollination.
Public relations has evolved throughout history, with roots in press agentry and propaganda, and is characterized by different models, such as press agentry/publicity, public information, two-way asymmetrical, and two-way symmetrical. Pioneers like Ivy Lee, Edward Bernays, and Doris Fleischman helped shape the field through various strategies and campaigns. Studying PR history is important for practitioners to learn from past successes and failures, understand basic principles, and provide context for current events. American PR history has influenced differences between U.S. public relations and those in other countries, but cross-pollination has occurred.
Ethics, including transparency, objectivity, and advocacy, are cornerstones of public relations. Transparency respects others' autonomy in informed decision-making, while objectivity is the pursuit of truth in a practical sense. Advocacy is acceptable in public relations as long as transparency is maintained. Digital strategies, social media, and SEO have become crucial aspects of modern public relations, shaping communication and motivations such as recruitment, legitimacy, agitation, advocacy, and profit. The most important lesson for students from PR history is to be ethical, as the truth always comes out.




	

	

	Identify the Real Father of Public Relations




	Ivy Lee and Edward Bernays are frequently regarded as the founding fathers of public relations, with both of them making substantial contributions to the field. Despite their shared influence, their methodologies and philosophies differ significantly, making it challenging to attribute the title exclusively to one individual.
Ivy Lee is known for his emphasis on transparency and truthfulness, which laid the foundation for ethical public relations practices. His work with large corporations, like the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Rockefellers, demonstrated the importance of managing public perception and establishing positive public images. Lee's approach to PR was groundbreaking at the time and still influences PR practices today.
Edward Bernays’ method, compared to Lee’s, relied more on research and persuasion. His campaigns for Venida hair nets, Procter & Gamble's Ivory soap, and Lucky Strike cigarettes showed how effective PR can be at shaping public opinion. Bernays' work went beyond Lee's approach, as he used research and persuasion to achieve his clients' goals, exemplifying the two-way asymmetrical model. His partnership with Doris Fleischman may have influenced the balanced, two-way symmetrical communication model, which has been widely adopted in modern PR practices. Bernays' efforts to professionalize public relations through lectures and publications have also been instrumental in defining the field.
Ivy Lee and Edward Bernays both made significant contributions to PR by developing various models and practices within the field. While it is difficult to assign the title of father of public relations to just one of them, both have shaped the profession and continue to influence its evolution today.




	Excellent, Jed. This was somewhat of a trick question. Both men contributed significantly to the field. I just wanted you to become a little familiar with each of them.




	

	What do Search Results Reveal About a Company's Image?


	Searching for “health food” on Google gives you pages of prominent health food retailers, nutrition websites, and news articles. Some of the organizations that appeared on the first page are Whole Foods Market, Healthline, WebMD, EatingWell, and CNN. Generally speaking, the links are mostly articles related to health food trends, benefits, and advice, as well as online stores selling health food products. Additionally, some links direct users to pages that provide guidance on selecting the best health food products or understanding specific dietary requirements.
The implications of these search results for the organizations' reputations are significant. Appearing on the first page of search results implies that these organizations are credible, authoritative, and trusted by both users and the search engine algorithms. This visibility and perceived legitimacy can lead to increased traffic, brand recognition, and ultimately, customer loyalty. Organizations that consistently rank high in organic search results are more likely to be perceived as reliable sources of information; which can have a positive impact on their overall reputation and public image.




	Very good, Jed. You are knocking it out of the park so far in this class.

	Chapter 3
	"Managing Public Relations" by Grunig and Hunt offers an expansive overview of the evolution of public relations (PR), tracing its roots in press agentry and propaganda to its development as a crucial management function. The authors describe four historical models of PR: press agentry/publicity, public information, two-way asymmetrical, and two-way symmetrical.
The press agentry model, seen in P.T. Barnum's promotion of Joice Heth and more recently in IHOP's name change to IHOb for publicity, prioritizes attention-grabbing with little concern for truth. On the other hand, the public information model, associated with PR pioneer Ivy Lee, emphasizes the distribution of truthful and accurate information. Lee's "Declaration of Principles" signified a shift towards transparency and accuracy, a practice that remains crucial in today's corporate communication, where companies are legally obliged to release material information affecting investors' decisions.
The two-way asymmetrical and symmetrical models highlight two-way communication between an organization and its publics. Public relations theorists James and Larissa Grunig and practitioners like Edward Bernays and Earl Newsom have made significant contributions to these models. Bernays, known for his orchestrated events such as the "Torches of Freedom" march, used research to understand public sentiment, develop strategy, and evaluate results, shifting PR towards a two-way model of communication.
The symmetrical model, seen in Newsom's safety campaign for Ford and Robbie Alm's community-based problem-solving at Hawaii's largest public utility, promotes mutual understanding and benefits. However, it's important to note that these models, while providing a useful abstraction of PR activities, have been criticized for oversimplification.
The work of Bernays, his wife Doris Fleischman, and Joseph V. Baker, the first African American PR professional to gain national prominence, underlines the importance of understanding public sentiment and maintaining transparency in corporate communication. Despite some controversial tactics, these figures have significantly shaped the field of PR.
The impact of PR extends far beyond the 20th century and the rise of modern business in America, influencing politics, religion, education, and reform movements. PR activities have been driven by various motivations such as recruitment, legitimacy, agitation, advocacy, and profit. The advent of the internet and social media has further changed the landscape of PR, creating new opportunities and challenges. In the digital age, transparency remains paramount, with the rise of practices such as search engine optimization (SEO) and the use of social media for campaigns.
Dr. Karen Miller Russell emphasizes the importance of studying PR history to understand effective strategies, learn basic PR principles, and provide context for present-day events. She also discusses how history and culture shaped PR practices in different countries, with the US exporting some aspects of its PR practices post-WWII. As we move forward, PR practitioners have access to more scientific research and online data to understand their audiences and measure the success of PR efforts.




	

	

	Differentiating Between PR, Advertising, and Marketing

Pages
Defining Terms:
1. Public Relations (PR): PR is the practice of managing the spread of information
between an individual or an organization and the public. This involves the
management of an organization's reputation, creating a positive image, and
fostering beneficial relationships with stakeholders. PR often involves two-way
communication and feedback.
2. Advertising: This is the process of creating, communicating, delivering, and
exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society
at large. Advertising is usually paid, with the organization controlling the
message, its timing, and frequency. It's often more product or service-focused
and less interactive than PR.
3. Marketing: Marketing is a broader term that encompasses identifying,
anticipating, and satisfying customer needs and wants profitably. It includes
advertising, but also involves activities like market research, product
development, distribution, customer support, and PR.
I’m choosing Starbucks as my company to examine.
On Facebook, Starbucks has a mix of product promotions (advertising), shared user-
generated content, and corporate responsibility posts (PR). They interact with their
followers by replying to comments and addressing concerns, which demonstrates the
two-way communication model
Instagram showcases more of an advertising and marketing approach. The platform is
filled with photos of their drink and food items, often promoting new releases or limited-
time offerings. They also share user-generated content, giving customers a sense of
participation and community.
YouTube primarily serves as an advertising and PR platform for Starbucks. They post
well-produced commercials (advertising), as well as videos showcasing their corporate
social responsibility efforts, such as their commitment to sustainability (PR). Interaction
with viewers is minimal on this platform.
In conclusion, Starbucks effectively leverages different social media platforms for varied
purposes, integrating PR, advertising, and marketing strategies. While they interact with
the public on all platforms, the level of interaction varies, suggesting different target
audiences for each platform. Their approach on Facebook seems more PR-focused
with considerable interaction, Instagram leans more towards advertising and marketing
with its visual focus, and YouTube balances PR and advertising with high-quality,
message-focused content.

Opening music plays, a soft melody that evokes a sense of adventure and nature.
Aerial shot of a breathtaking mountain range, the sun just beginning to rise.
Narrator: "There's a world out there waiting to be explored."
Cut to a group of hikers wearing Patagonia gear, starting their journey at the base of the mountain.
Narrator: "A world that breathes, changes, and challenges us."
The hikers navigate through various terrains - forests, rivers, rocky paths.
Narrator: "At Patagonia, we believe in embracing these challenges, not just for the thrill of the adventure..."
The hikers help each other overcome obstacles, showcasing teamwork and camaraderie.
Narrator: "...but for the love of our planet."
The hikers pause to pick up litter along the trail, placing it in reusable bags.
Narrator: "Because every step we take is a chance to make a difference."
Close-up shots of the hikers' faces, showing determination and care.
Narrator: "Join us in our mission to protect the world we play in."
The hikers reach the summit, looking out at the view with a sense of accomplishment.
Closing music fades in, mirroring the opening melody.
The Patagonia logo appears on the screen, along with the tagline: "For the love of our planet."


This video would appeal to Patagonia's target audience by aligning the brand with environmental stewardship and outdoor adventure, without explicitly advertising any specific products. It emphasizes the company's values and mission, which is a key aspect of content marketing.






	Go back and take another look at the chapter and at the examples I provided, Jed. You have primarily created a commercial for Pategonia here rather than content marketing. (It would be great as a commercial but that's not what you are trying to accomplish through this assignment.)


For content marketing you create content that a person chooses to view because of the content and not necessarily because of the brand. In other words, it's content that the viewer would seek out no matter who created it. When you pick a TV show to watch you probably don't pick that show based on which company is sponsoring it, right? The same is true for content marketing.


For instance, Red Bull produces lots of content featuring extreme sports. They don't actually advertise their product beyond a logo on a helmet or end screen. And the people who view and share the content are doing so because they want to share the cool video of the sport rather than to specifically advertise for Red Bull. Red Bull still benefits, however, because extreme sports fits with the ethos of the brand and the content helps to build its reputation as a "cool" company within its customer demographics. It's slightly more subtle than directly advertising the product and is more focused on the brand's reputation.

	Chapter 4 Summary: [Summary:[The text discusses the role and importance of public relations (PR) in an organization, particularly in managing relationships with various stakeholders. It emphasizes that PR is not just about generating favorable publicity, but also about managing mutually beneficial relationships with the public.
The text highlights the shift in focus from publicity to relationships in PR that started in the 1980s. It mentions the work of Professors Mary Ann Ferguson, John Ledingham, and Stephen Bruning who advocated for relationships to be at the core of PR scholarship.
The rise of social media has further emphasized the importance of relationship building in PR, as it provides a more direct and conversational way of communicating with the public.
The text also discusses the strategies for maintaining successful relationships, based on the work of Professors Dan Canary and Laura Stafford. These strategies include positivity, openness, assurances, social networking, and sharing tasks. These strategies were later adapted for public relationships by Professors Linda Hon and James Grunig.
The benefits of these relationships can come in many forms, such as exchange relationships where both parties receive something of value. For example, a customer gets a product or service, and the company earns sales revenue.
In summary, the text underscores the importance of PR in managing relationships with stakeholders, and the shift from publicity to relationship building in the field. It also provides strategies for maintaining successful relationships and discusses the benefits of these relationships.]
Summary:[The text discusses the importance of maintaining relationships in public relations, specifically focusing on news-driven relationships and media relations. It emphasizes the parallels between interpersonal relationships and organization-public relationships, suggesting that both require effective communication and mutual understanding.
St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is used as an example of an organization that maintains strong relationships with its publics, though the specific outcomes of these relationships are not detailed in the text.
The text also explores the concept of pitching, which is when public relations practitioners encourage the news media to cover stories involving their organizations. It highlights the importance of understanding newsworthiness, which is the criterion journalists use to determine what is worth covering as news. The elements of newsworthiness include timeliness, proximity, conflict and controversy, human interest, and relevance.
The text also discusses the rise of online services like PR Newswire’s ProfNet or Vocus’s HARO (Help a Reporter Out) that connect reporters with sources, a practice known as media catching. This practice reverses the traditional flow of pitching from sources to reporters, allowing journalists to post queries online to which any registered user with relevant information or expertise can respond.
In summary, the text underscores the importance of maintaining relationships in public relations, the role of pitching and understanding newsworthiness in media relations, and the emergence of media catching as a new practice in the field.]
Summary:[The text discusses commerce-driven relationships in public relations, focusing on business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B), and employee relations.
B2C relationships refer to the interactions between businesses and their customers. This includes e-commerce platforms where end users can initiate and complete transactions online. The text uses Amazon as an example of a B2C company that sells products directly to consumers online.
B2B relationships refer to the interactions between businesses. This includes transactions involving raw materials, component parts, assembly, delivery, intellectual property, and more. The text highlights that B2B buyers are usually well-informed and make rational, highly informed purchasing decisions. Public relations play a role in B2B relationships, with tactics and channels of communication used for relationships with other key publics.
Employee relations refer to the relationships between an organization and its internal publics, i.e., its employees. Trust, satisfaction, commitment, and control mutuality are important relational outcomes in employee relations. Trusting, satisfied, committed, and empowered employees are more productive and more invested in the organization’s mission. The text emphasizes that healthy internal relations are prerequisites for healthy external ones.
In summary, the text highlights the importance of maintaining commerce-driven relationships in public relations, focusing on B2C, B2B, and employee relations. It underscores the role of trust in employee relations and the importance of understanding the nature of B2C and B2B relationships




	

	

	Social Media Use by a Major Organization


	Tesla's approach to social media is just like how they do business, it's not just about selling cars, but also about sharing what they stand for with their followers and customers. They've got a whopping 20.1 million followers on Twitter, showing just how much people are into what they're doing. This huge following gives Tesla a direct line to followers all over the world, letting them share news and updates in real time. And with over 8,158 tweets, they're not just posting for likes, they're having a conversation with their audience, engaging them with the brand.
When Tesla tweets about new products, it's not just about keeping followers up to date, but also about showing their commitment to pushing the envelope and staying ahead of the game. All of this adds up to reinforce Tesla's position as a leader in the market.
They also tweet about their achievements, like the production rate at the Giga Texas facility and the start of their own lithium refinery. These tweets show off Tesla's progress and growth, and underline their commitment to sustainability and clean energy, which is right in line with their mission to lead the way in sustainable energy.
Tesla's tweets about their corporate social responsibility initiatives, like opening a lithium refinery in Corpus Christi, TX, highlight their dedication to sustainability and being good stewards of the environment. These tweets build Tesla's image as a company that's thinking about the future.
And when they tweet about their investment in AI and deep learning technologies, and their commitment to their employees, it shows that they're all about innovation and people. They even highlighted a post about receiving 3.6 million job applications and hiring 29k new employees.
In conclusion, Tesla strategically uses Twitter to reinforce its position as a market leader. When they tweet about the latest and greatest products, they're showing everyone they're all about innovation and staying one step ahead. This shows how Tesla is using social media as a super powerful tool to connect with their audience and boost their brand image. This strategy doesn't just make Tesla look good, it also serves as a great case study of how a company should interact with its public.




	This is excellent with the exception that you only seemed to look at Tesla's Twitter account, Jed. (I think they have around five handles.) Tesla can also be found on Instagram, YouTube and LinkedIn. How are they using these platforms?

	Chapter 5 delves into the integral role of research in public relations, particularly within the RPIE (Research, Planning, Implementation, Evaluation) cycle. It explores various facets of research, including formative and summative research, situation analysis, quantitative and qualitative research, and the cost-benefit analysis of secondary and primary research. It also discusses formal and informal research methods and the application of utilitarianism as an ethical principle in public relations research.


    Formative research, conducted at the start or during the implementation of a plan, helps formulate goals, objectives, strategies, and tactics. It can be formal or informal and employs methods such as web analytics, surveys, and interviews. Summative research, on the other hand, is carried out at the end of a campaign to evaluate its success in achieving set goals and outcomes.


    Research is a vital tool in campaign planning as it answers crucial questions and offers insights for future campaigns. It transforms hindsight into foresight by learning from past experiences and applying that knowledge to enhance future strategies.


    Situation analysis is a key component of public relations planning. It provides the context for identifying problems or opportunities by analyzing the current situation, paving the way for strategic planning. Techniques like SWOT analysis are used to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.


    The chapter also differentiates between researching factors of internal origin (strengths and weaknesses) and those of external origin (opportunities and threats). Strengths are positive internal factors that aid in achieving organizational goals, while weaknesses are internal limitations that obstruct goal fulfillment. Opportunities and threats, on the other hand, are external factors that can either benefit or pose risks to the organization.


    Researching strengths involves identifying and understanding the organization's positive aspects, such as community-benefiting projects or faculty involvement in external organizations. Conversely, researching weaknesses requires identifying areas of improvement within the organization, such as communication gaps or lack of training.


    Researching opportunities entails identifying external circumstances that can benefit the organization, while researching threats involves analyzing external risks like competition or financial challenges. These factors require careful examination, prioritization, and understanding of their interrelationships.


    In conclusion, research plays a pivotal role in effective public relations planning, implementation, and evaluation. It aids professionals in making informed decisions and demonstrating the value of their work.

	This is fine, Jed. Students often write about this campaign but it is a good one. Make sure you examine more than just the social media aspects of this campaign. Examine what earned media the company got out of the campaign as well.




	

	Conduct Observational Research


	I decided to do my observations at the new Starbucks in Pickens. Such a public place gave me the opportunity to observe a wide range of men's hair and facial hairstyles. After I grabbed my order, I made sure to keep a safe distance and picked a corner seat that gave me a clear view of the entrance.


In just 45 minutes, I saw a whole host of hairstyles. To make sense of my observations, I made a chart with the first few hairstyles I saw, adding new ones when I saw them, and ticked each time I spotted someone with that style. The ladies most popular hairstyle was long and straight, seen in 18 out of the 45 women I observed. Short bob cuts were sported by 12 women, while 10 had medium-length wavy hair, and the remaining 5 had a mix of styles, including braids and ponytails. For the gentlemen, short, cropped hair was the most popular, seen in 20 out of the 40 men. Beards of various lengths were sported by 15 men, and 5 had mustaches. The rest were clean-shaven.
The entire experience of conducting observational research was very useful. I tried to be as unnoticeable and respectful as possible, focusing on hairstyles without making anyone feel uncomfortable. I did find that distractions, like loud conversations or even my own occasional distraction with my coffee, could interfere with my observation. There were times when I had to consciously bring my attention back to the task.
Keeping track of the observations was a challenge that required a systematic approach. I had my chart at the ready and a pen in hand to quickly note down the hairstyle of each new customer entering the store. To keep count, I used tally marks for each hairstyle category, ensuring that I didn't lose track.
In conclusion, this exercise gave me a practical understanding of direct observation as a research method. It demonstrated the importance of focus, organization, and discretion in observational research. It was a valuable hands-on experience that supplemented the theoretical knowledge I had gained from the textbook.






	Excellent, Jed. I had you do this assignment just so that you could see how simple observation might help inform your public relations planning. We often think about research in terms of surveys and focus groups, but sometimes just observing or participating can provide valuable insights. For instance, if you had been hired to provide PR services for a new salon coming to town, you might do something like this just to get a feel for the most popular hairstyles in a specific geographic area.

	Develop a Problem/Opportunity Statement


	Our problem is that our reading program in the school district, which pairs retired adults with first-graders for a rich reading experience outside of school hours, is currently serving a small group of students. We have an untapped opportunity to broaden its impact to a larger number of children who could greatly benefit from it.
Our mission is to ramp up the number of participating adults to cater to approximately 500 students across the district who could use this program. This is crucial to ensure that all students have an equal shot at additional reading support, which has been shown to turbocharge their learning.
This is a public relations and communication challenge because it involves effectively marketing the program to potential adult volunteers and orchestrating communication between schools, volunteers, and families to ensure the program's triumph.




	This is a strong problem statement, Jed. Writing a problem or opportunity statement is a crucial step in the public relations process because you are unlikely to develop a successful plan if you can't clearly articulate what the issue is. This statement is also very important as you work with clients. Always make sure that you and your client are in agreement about this statement before you start planning. If the client sees the problem in a different way than you do, you may develop a plan that is not in alignment with the client's vision. This may cost you time and money as well as frustrate the client.

Implementation


Chapter Summary: Chapter 7 delves into the RPIE (research-planning-implementation-evaluation) process's implementation phase in public relations. It highlights the importance of meaningful action, stating that effective public relations hinge not merely on communication, but also on principled actions. Examples from the American Red Cross and Ford Motor Company serve to underline this concept. Further emphasis is laid on the vital role of appropriate communication channels in public relations. Organizations are advised to make educated decisions regarding which channels to use, when to use them, and for what purpose, emphasizing the necessity of assessing the benefits and drawbacks of various media for communication with their publics.
In discussing media options, the chapter introduces concepts like controlled, uncontrolled, and shared control media. Controlled media, such as newsletters or TV ads, provide exact control over message, delivery, and audience, while uncontrolled media, including newspapers and blogs, do not offer control after the message is handed to a third party. A balance is found in situations like press conferences where control is shared.
Further categorization of media options is provided as "Owned, Paid, Shared, and Earned Media." Owned Media comprises channels like newsletters, websites, blogs, where organizations control the message and delivery. Paid Media is primarily advertising, either traditional or digital, including platforms like Google AdWords, banner ads, and native advertising. Shared Media pertains to sharing via social media, and Earned Media involves news coverage or followers acquired through the organization's activities or high-quality content. These media categories aid in creating effective communication strategies, considering factors such as control level, cost, reach, and interactivity.
The chapter also presents case studies highlighting the principles discussed. One focuses on Chipotle Mexican Grill's response to a severe food safety crisis in 2016, showing how the company maintained relationships with its publics through action and communication, sticking to its commitment to quality ingredients and respectful farming practices. Another instance involves Lockheed Martin's social media campaign backfiring due to negative publicity, showcasing the risks of open-ended social media campaigns.
Moreover, the chapter illustrates how a mix of owned, paid, shared, and earned media can be used effectively through the BarkBox case study. BarkBox employed humor and user-generated content across social media platforms, sponsored events, and philanthropy, gradually venturing into traditional media and physical retail spaces, showing adaptability and responsiveness in its implementation strategy.
Diversity, ethics, and communication are also highlighted as critical components in public relations, with a focus on Wells Fargo's "Re-Established" campaign led by Rosanna M. Fiske, senior vice president of corporate communications. The campaign aimed at improving the company's reputation by concentrating on core values including customer centricity, ethics, diversity and inclusion, and leadership. Kimberly-Clark's diversity promotion efforts serve as a practical example of how diversity initiatives contribute to business success, resulting in significant increases in women in leadership roles and internal promotions of women.
Key terms in this chapter include advertorial, brochureware, controlled media, corporate advertising, direct-to-consumer, diversity, glass ceiling, loyalty, media gatekeepers, native advertising, pay per click, third-party credibility, and uncontrolled media.




	

	

	What Makes Social Media Uncontrolled?


	Chapter 7 got me thinking about the control, or lack thereof, we have over social media in the world of public relations. It's easy to think that we, as PR practitioners, have the reins, but the truth is once a post goes live, it's kind of out of our hands.
Social media is like a wild horse, you can guide it, but you can't totally control where it goes. We might create the content, but the moment it gets posted, it's up for grabs. Users can comment, share, twist, and spin our messages, turning our well-planned post into something we didn't quite anticipate.
Social media blurs the lines between owned, paid, shared, and earned media. One moment it's an owned channel, the next it’s being shared and talked about by influencers and random users. Our content is out there living its own life, and sometimes, it's a life we didn't exactly plan for it.
Despite this wild ride, it's not all doom and gloom. We can't control the narrative entirely, but we can set a solid foundation. It's all about crafting our messages with care, responding to feedback, and keeping an eye on the conversation. Plus, building strong relationships with your audience can help to strengthen your reputation in crisis times.
To sum up, the world of social media in public relations is a balancing act. While we can do everything in our power to create a thoughtful message, we can't control everything that comes after. But knowing this and navigating the unpredictability is what makes PR so engaging.






	This is a well-written and well-reasoned response, Jed. You are doing excellent work in this course.


	

	The Value of Sharing


	So, I took on the task of scrutinizing my own social media accounts. Funny enough, I found a big fat zero in the shared content column for the past week. I'm more of an observer on social media platforms rather than an active participant. I scroll, I read, I watch, but I don't necessarily engage by sharing or posting much.
The reasons are twofold. First, I tend to consume content more passively, using these platforms to stay informed about what's happening in the world, with friends, and in areas of interest to me. So, I'm more likely to be found browsing my feeds and stories rather than resharing them.
Secondly, I have an innate tendency to keep my online presence on the down-low. For me, social media is where I like to relax, I find the task of posting things and trying to keep up with them, and then starting it over every day or week or whenever, very tiring. I like to keep my off time as stress-free as possible, and I plan to keep it that way.
However, this exercise was eye-opening in terms of understanding my own digital footprint, or lack thereof. It was also interesting to reflect on Chapter 7's content and its relevance to my own social media behavior. While I don't contribute much to the realm of shared media, I realize how vital it is in the digital communication landscape.
In the end, it's clear that the concept of sharing on social media isn't one-size-fits-all. We all interact with these platforms in our unique ways, and that's what makes the social media world so diverse and vibrant. It's a melting pot of personalities, behaviors, and content, and I'm happy to be a part of it, even if it's from the backseat.






	Good, Jed. It's interesting but I am finding that as we move deeper into the social media era, there's a growing number of users like you who views social media without reacting to it or sharing it. When social media arrived on the scene, the "social" part, with its interactivity, was all the rage and many people do still focus on their interactions but the number of these folks do seem to be on the decline. I wanted you to do this exercise, of course, because I wanted you to see which organizations were having an impact on you to the point that you were sharing their material. Organizations are constantly seeking to not only reach you with their messages but to entice you to help them spread their messages through sharing.

Dove's "Real Beauty" campaign isn't just another PR campaign; it's a beacon of how PR can transcend beyond product promotion and stir meaningful societal dialogues. This campaign is a shining testament to the power of PR to disrupt societal norms and effect positive change.
It demonstrates how brands can responsibly use their influence to address social issues, earning not just profits, but also respect and loyalty from their consumers.
The success of Dove's campaign inspires other brands to reflect on their communication strategies and think about how they too can contribute to more inclusive and positive narratives in society.
	This is a very good presentation, Jed. It hits all of the marks overall. It is attractive, well-organized and thorough. Here are just a few notes for future presentations: - Very minor but remember to introduce yourself. - In thinking about the purpose of the campaign, remember that enhancing the reputation of the company is always the ultimate goal but they choose to do this by challenging the societal norms you mention. It's kind of a chick and egg thing in a way but ultimately a company is always looking to benefit itself in some way. - I know what you mean when you say the campaign was targeting women worldwide but does the company really sell to all women? I think you are realistically looking at a target audience of women in North America and Europe who are in a specific income demographic. - In putting together a presentation, you generally want to put fewer words on the screen and more in your presentation notes. Audiences do not read slides with lots of words and you don't want to tempt yourself to turn around and read the slides. In this case, most of the words on your slides should actually be in your presentation notes rather than vice versa. - I don't understand the graph on your "results" slide.

	Chapter 8
	Chapter 8 appears to be dedicated to the evaluation and measurement of public relations (PR) programs, with a focus on digital measurement and ethical considerations. Here are the key concepts discussed in the chapter:
Importance of Measurement and Evaluation: The chapter begins by emphasizing the need for regular and systematic evaluation of PR programs, campaigns, and strategies to determine their effectiveness and to guide future activities.
Digital Technology and PR Measurement: The transformative role of digital technologies in PR evaluation is discussed. A range of digital tools, such as A/B testing, media monitoring services, and advanced data analytics, are described as key to understanding and measuring online visitor behavior, social media activity, and online conversations.
Social Media Metrics: The chapter emphasizes the role of social media metrics in evaluating the performance of PR programs. Tools like Google Analytics and Brand Lift are mentioned as being helpful in measuring organizational performance. The importance of aligning these metrics with defined PR goals and objectives is underscored.
Big Data and PR: The impact of big data on the PR industry is highlighted, with a focus on its ability to strengthen predictive models for future campaigns. The use of algorithms and machine learning in refining decision-making processes in PR is also discussed.
Industry Standards: The chapter presents the Barcelona Principles as industry standards for PR research and evaluation. These principles guide how PR professionals should conduct and report their research and evaluations to ensure they are transparent, consistent, valid, and linked to the organization's goals.
Ethics and Independence: The chapter emphasizes the ethical considerations in PR measurement and evaluation. PR professionals are encouraged to maintain independence and objectivity when interpreting data, despite their advocacy roles. Various potential pitfalls, including misuse of statistics and data distortion, are highlighted.
Preparation for PR Careers: For aspiring PR professionals, the chapter advises broadening their skillset by learning research methods and statistical analysis, not only within communication departments but also in fields like business, sociology, and psychology.
Behavioral Economics and Science: The potential of behavioral economics and science in understanding decision-making processes is discussed. The chapter suggests that this area of research could provide valuable insights into consumer attitudes and behaviors.
Interpretation of Research Data: The chapter concludes by stressing the importance of interpreting research data to the organization accurately and responsibly. It reminds PR practitioners of their role in interpreting the organization to the public and vice versa, and the potential traps that they should avoid when interpreting and reporting data.




	

	

	Evaluating Advocacy Advertising


	Advocacy advertising is when a company makes ads about societal ideals or issues, instead of just trying to sell their products or services. For example, Gillette's “We Believe: The Best Men Can Be” ad. This ad talks about big problems in society, like bullying, harassment, and the #MeToo movement. It asks men to think differently about what it means to be a man and to act better.
Thinking about this from a business point of view, advocacy advertising can be both good and bad. It can help a company stand out and connect with customers in a deeper way, but it can also stir controversy and make some people unhappy. In the case of Gillette, it seems like they knew some people might get upset, but they decided that showing they care about society and connecting with people who also care was worth the risk.
Whether companies should only talk about their products and services, and not get into culture and politics, depends on the company and its customers. Some customers like when companies don't pick sides, while others like when companies stand up for things they care about.
Figuring out if this kind of message works can be hard. Just looking at sales and money made might not tell the whole story of how an advocacy campaign did. Other things, like how people see the brand, how they interact on social media, and how much the media talks about them, can give a better picture. In the end, the company needs to decide what “success” means to them, keeping in mind their big business and communication goals.




	This is a very good response, Jed. This kind of advocacy advertising worked pretty well for Gillette but as our nation becomes more and more politically polarized, it is becoming harder for companies to take a stand on societal issues. The ongoing backlash that Budweiser is facing since it sent personalized memorabilia to transgender social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney is a case in point. I don't know that the company was really trying to do advocacy advertising as much as it was simply trying to tap into a new market for its beer but many of its conservative customers certainly took the company's actions negatively. I am pretty sure the company didn't expect that given that this wasn't a full-fledged advertising campaign but I suspect this incident may have an impact on other companies' decisions about touching on politically-sensitive topics in the future.

	Exam 2 Study Guide
	GPT Study Guide:


    Ethics in PR: PR practitioners often face complex ethical dilemmas. For instance, in a debate over raising the minimum wage, the ethical challenge is not about convincing both sides or eliminating the minimum wage, but about determining the most ethical course of action that balances various interests and potential consequences.


    SWOT Analysis: In a SWOT analysis, "Strengths" refer to internal positive attributes of an organization or situation. For example, a record of faculty involvement in community organizations could be considered a strength for a local college.


    Content Analysis: In content analysis, reliability and validity are key concepts. Reliability refers to the consistency of the measurement, such as using the same coding system to measure the quality of news coverage. Validity, on the other hand, refers to the accuracy of the measurement.


    Focus Groups: Focus groups are more effective when led by a trained moderator. This is because a trained moderator has the skills to facilitate discussion and ensure that all participants' views are heard.


    Types of Research: Quantitative research involves numerical data, such as demographic statistics, the number of email accounts that have received an invitation, or the number of people who respond to a Facebook invitation. Qualitative research, on the other hand, involves non-numerical data and focuses on understanding the meaning and experiences of individuals.


    Public Relations Terminology: There are various terms used in public relations that you should be familiar with. For instance, "summative research" is conducted at the end of a campaign to determine its effectiveness. A "mission statement" is a formal explanation of an organization’s steady, enduring purpose. A "latent public" according to James Grunig's situational theory of publics, refers to a group of people who are affected by a particular issue but don't yet realize it.


    Media and Communication: In a focus group, a trained moderator is essential to facilitate the discussion effectively. In terms of media, there are controlled media (where communicators can control the message exactly how they want it) and uncontrolled media (where the organization has no direct control over the content). Shared media refers to content shared by users on social media platforms.


    Public Relations Strategies: In a PR plan, the strategy is the underlying logic that holds the plan together and offers a compelling rationale for why we expect the plan to work. Tactics are specific actions taken to implement the strategy. Objectives are specific, measurable steps that help meet the broader goal.


    Evaluation and Measurement in PR: In PR, it's important to distinguish between outputs (what has been done, such as the number of web pages developed or blog posts written) and outcomes (what you hope to accomplish, such as increased awareness or behavior change). Big data refers to the large volume of data that can be analyzed for insights. Surveys are used to gather data that describe demographics and what people think, feel, and do. Both qualitative and quantitative measures are important in evaluating a campaign.


    Digital Media: In digital media, pay-per-click advertising refers to a model where advertisers pay each time a user clicks on their online ad. Viral content is content that becomes very popular by being shared widely on the internet. The bounce rate is the percentage of visitors to a website who navigate away from the site after viewing only one page.

Engaging Influencers in Public Relations:
Engaging influencers helps organizations build trust and relatability.
It's important to choose influencers whose values align with the organization.
Various types of influencers include celebrities, top-tier influencers, opinion elites, micro-influencers, and brand advocates.
Quality and engagement of the audience are more important than size.
Influencers must comply with FTC guidelines for transparent partnership disclosures.
Disney and Make-A-Wish® Foundation collaboration is an example of a successful influencer campaign.
Public relations practitioners should embrace DIY multimedia, mobile media, and IoT to enhance communication strategies.
College students aspiring for a career in public relations should learn to code and understand digital platforms.
Diversity in public relations is essential and must be promoted as a viable career path in diverse communities.
Ethics, Privacy, and IoT in Communication:
IoT has become a significant mode of communication as various objects are capable of transmitting data.
There are privacy concerns associated with the transmission of data through IoT.
Trust is a crucial aspect, and organizations must safeguard the confidential data they collect.
The PRSA Code of Ethics emphasizes protecting privacy rights.
Competing values, such as information, entertainment, convenience, and privacy, must be weighed carefully.
Apple's refusal to unlock an iPhone for the FBI exemplifies an organization prioritizing user privacy.
Organizations must earn the public’s trust through ethical management.
Public relations professionals play a vital role in handling data ethically and should prioritize privacy protection to maintain public trust.
This consolidated summary encompasses the key points from both parts of the chapter, highlighting the important aspects of engaging influencers and understanding the implications of IoT on privacy and ethics in public relations.




	

	

	What Old Media Do You Like?


	The significance of old media is not usually something I think about in my everyday life. My personal old media use is almost non-existent; I use bluetooth in my car, I couldn’t tell you the last time I read something like a book or magazine on physical paper, and anything I watch is on a streaming service of one kind or another. However, an understanding and appreciation of old media helps us appreciate and look at new media in a different light.
I have a certain appreciation for physical books. The actual feeling of flipping through pages, the smell of the paper, and the lack of digital distractions is just something that you don't get with new media. Physical books also don't usually carry the eye strain that comes from staring at computer screens. Another old media that I appreciate is radio. Finding  new music, the sense of connection to the community around you who is also listening in, and the programming that something like 100 years has refined to nearly an exact science.
New media is certainly more stimulating and is very easy to choose over old media when most of it can be accessed with a smartphone. However, sometimes a low-intensity activity like reading a book or tuning out with the radio on can be just what I’m looking for.






	Thanks, Jed. Your experience is very typical of your generation. I love to hear about what old media, students are still using. The purpose of this assignment was to help you realize that even though we live in a world dominated by new technology, older ways of communicating are still reaching people and should not be neglected by professional communicators. For instance, social media is a great communication tool but it's still just one tool in a big toolbox.

	## Chapter 11: Navigating Ethics, Intellectual Property, and Legal Considerations in Public Relations


### Summary:


Chapter 11 explores the crucial role of public relations (PR) professionals in navigating the intricate landscape of ethics, intellectual property rights, privacy, and legal considerations. It emphasizes the significance of understanding national laws within global contexts, given the rise of international exchanges and globalization.


The chapter opens by emphasizing the importance of understanding the legal landscape, not only domestically but also internationally. It uses the case of Supap Kirtsaeng and the "first sale" doctrine to demonstrate how national laws are interpreted in international contexts and how globalization is influencing the legal framework.


The importance of the First Amendment in the United States and the role of PR professionals in the marketplace of ideas are highlighted. The chapter stresses the need to balance free speech with responsibilities, understanding that while free speech is a right, it is not unlimited and should not infringe on others' rights or reputations.


The chapter then dives into the complexities of intellectual property protection, focusing on copyright, trademarks, patents, and the role of Creative Commons licenses. It highlights the international distribution of digital content and the challenges it presents for intellectual property across borders.


Privacy, particularly within an international context, is a key area of exploration. The chapter discusses the legal rights and responsibilities related to privacy, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, and how international companies have had to adapt to these new regulations.


Defamation, including libel and slander, is examined in-depth. The modern ramifications of defamation laws on social media are also explored with the introduction of the term "twibel," signifying libel on Twitter.


The roles and responsibilities of various U.S. federal agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are identified. These agencies regulate communication to protect the public, highlighting the need for PR professionals to be familiar with these agencies.


Next, the chapter distinguishes between intellectual property and public domain information, highlighting laws like the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in the United States that ensure government information is accessible to citizens. It points out that more than 100 U.S. agencies are subject to FOIA and underscores their obligation to respond to information requests and proactively provide useful information.


The chapter further underscores the ethical balance between protecting organizational confidences and respecting the privacy of individual social media accounts. It raises questions around whether social networks can be considered trade secrets and discusses the ethical implications of organizations claiming ownership over employees' social media accounts.


Lastly, the chapter advises caution with sharing content on social media, the use of customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and the handling of large amounts of data. PR professionals are urged to respect customer trust, avoid common legal mistakes such as oversharing on social media, and understand the legal contexts both nationally and internationally.


In conclusion, Chapter 11 provides a comprehensive guide for PR professionals, equipping them with the knowledge and tools necessary to navigate the legal and ethical landscape of their field. The chapter reinforces the importance of adherence to legal norms, respecting intellectual property, ensuring transparency, protecting privacy, safeguarding confidential information, and ultimately, building trust and maintaining credibility in public relations.




	

	

	Twibel


	The determination of whether a statement is defamatory depends on various factors:


The statement must be able to be proven false
It must be proven to harm someone's reputation.
It must have been spoken or otherwise received by at least one other person.
The subject must be identifiable.
The statement must be factual in nature.
Opinions, hyperbole, and/or name-calling don’t meet the criteria for defamation because they can’t be proven to be true or false.
The entity who made the statement must have done so with intentional malice.


If Best Burger is considered a public figure or entity, the legal threshold for defamation may be higher, requiring the demonstration of actual malice, where the defendant knowingly made a false statement or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.


"Best Burger is the WORST restaurant EVER!!! #nevereathere"
This tweet appears to be someone expressing their strong negative opinion about Best Burger. It uses hyperbole and subjective language to convey their dissatisfaction.
This statement is someone’s subjective experience, akin to a review of the restaurant.
"Best Burger’s food tastes like cardboard. It isn’t even real food."
This tweet also expresses a personal opinion about the taste of Best Burger's food. It uses subjective language to convey the individual's dissatisfaction.
Like the previous tweet, it is difficult to prove this statement as false, as taste preferences vary among individuals.
"Best Burger is not worth the price. They use dog food to make their hamburgers."
In this tweet, the person is making a claim that Best Burger uses dog food in their hamburgers.
If this statement is false, it could potentially be considered defamatory because it implies a harmful fact about Best Burger's business practices.


The issue in the third tweet would be proving actual harm to the company directly because of the tweet. Perhaps, if it went viral worldwide and seriously impacted their stock values, then I could definitely see it being legally defamatory.






	Excellent analysis, Jed.


	Module 12
	Chapter 12
	Chapter 12 provides an in-depth exploration of conflict and crisis management in the field of public relations (PR). It delves into the various strategies for managing conflicts, the role of social media, and ethical considerations in these situations.


The chapter introduces conflict management, examining different PR responses, which vary from pure advocacy to pure accommodation. Using case studies like "United Breaks Guitars" and "Brandon Stanton vs. DKNY," it underscores the Contingency Theory, asserting that the appropriate response often hinges on the specifics of the situation.


Next, it presents the "issues life cycle," delineating the stages through which an issue progresses, from early/potential, emerging, current/crisis, to dormant. It highlights how an issue's progression through these stages can influence an organization's proactive management strategies.


The chapter introduces a seven-step proactive issues management process involving monitoring, identification, prioritization, analysis, strategic planning, implementation, and evaluation. This framework helps organizations identify potential issues early, facilitating strategic PR and mitigating the need for reactive damage control.


In terms of crisis categorization, the chapter differentiates between victim crises, where the organization is perceived as innocent, accident crises, which attribute some responsibility to the organization, and preventable crises, typically the result of mismanagement, illegal actions, or unethical conduct.


The chapter discusses various crisis response strategies, including deny strategies, which aim to absolve the organization of responsibility; diminish strategies, designed to minimize the organization's responsibility or intentions; rebuild strategies, which involve accepting responsibility and mending relationships; and reinforce strategies, where the organization reminds the public of its positive past actions or intentions.


The chapter further examines the role of traditional media, social media, and word-of-mouth communication in disseminating crisis information. It underscores the significance of influential social media creators, followers, and inactives in this process.


The final section investigates ethical conflicts in PR, showcasing a case study where a PR professional faces a difficult dilemma due to personal connections to the conflict. It encourages PR professionals to advocate for transparency by applying crisis communication theory and demonstrating a deep understanding of the affected publics.


The chapter concludes with a self-assessment, discussion questions, and key terms for the reader's review. It stresses the importance of prompt action, strategic planning, ethical considerations, and effective social media use in managing PR crises and conflicts. It also introduces the "stealing thunder" strategy, which involves proactively disclosing negative information about an organization to maintain control over the narrative, further emphasizing the need for proactive management in public relations.












	

	

	Crisis Response Strategy




	Conflict and Crisis Management:
Bud Light found itself embroiled in a public relations crisis due to the backlash from a promotional campaign. It employed a mixture of strategies, leaning towards the "diminish" and "rebuild" response strategies. In this case, Bud Light sought to minimize their responsibility and intentions, stating that the commemorative can was a gift and not a product for general sale.
The Issues Life Cycle:
The Bud Light crisis began as an emerging issue with backlash on social media, which quickly escalated into a current/crisis stage as sales of Bud Light dropped significantly and the controversy expanded to affect other brands.
Proactive Issues Management Process:
Bud Light appeared to be more reactive than proactive in their crisis management. They responded to the crisis with a statement from the CEO, which indirectly referred to the controversy, and implemented changes in their leadership.
Crisis Categorization:
This crisis could be categorized as a preventable crisis, as it was the result of a marketing decision that sparked backlash, leading to a significant drop in sales and a tarnished reputation.
Crisis Response Strategies:
Bud Light used a combination of diminish and rebuild strategies. They sought to diminish their role by emphasizing that the controversial can was not a general sale item but a one-time gift​. As part of the rebuild strategy, they replaced the executive behind the partnership and offered to buy back beer from their distributors that didn't sell following the controversy.
Role of Media in Crisis:
The media played a significant role in amplifying the crisis. The backlash unfolded largely on social media platforms and was covered extensively in traditional media. Both Bud Light and the influencer, Dylan Mulvaney, used social media to respond to the crisis.
Ethical Conflicts in PR:
Bud Light faced ethical conflicts as it navigated the crisis, with concerns raised about their commitment to the LGBTQ+ community and criticism for their perceived inconsistency in response to the backlash.
Stealing Thunder Strategy:
Bud Light did not employ the "stealing thunder" strategy, as they were reactive rather than proactive in disclosing negative information about the controversy.
In conclusion, Bud Light's response to the crisis demonstrated a combination of strategies aligned with the concepts discussed in Chapter 12. However, the company's approach was largely reactive, and it faced criticism for its handling of the situation, highlighting the importance of proactive management and consistent messaging in public relations.
